# Publish Markdown to Medium in 2 Minutes

## Introduction
Markdown is a simple and powerful tools to writing your notes, etc. Even Notion supports exporting as markdown. Why not publish your study note to share knowledge?

Here, I will introduce the way I found to publish markdown to medium in minutes. The first thing you need is Github. And the second one is medium Account.

- [x] Github Account
- [x] Medium Account


Then we can begin!

## Setting up Medium Tokens

After you have registered with Medium, go to your setting.

Then find the **Integration tokens**.

Generate one with the name you like and copy it.

## Put and sort your markdown files

There are two ways to deal with the repository
- clone the repository to your local machine using **Git**
- using **Add files** provided by github website

Follow these steps
- For markdown files, put all your markdown files to **medium-posts** folder.

- For images in markdown files, copy all your images to **data/images**

#### To notice
Images should use the url web resources to display such as

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-github-name/md2medium/main/data/images/demo.jpg

Change **your-github-name** to your github name

Don't forget to set repository to **public** for access.

## Commit the files and finish!

Once you commit the files, the github will do the jobs directly for you!

You can check it using **Actions** in the github repository web page.

Once you see draft in your Medium Story. 
**Congrats!**
