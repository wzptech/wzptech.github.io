# Biography

I am currently a King's College London student studying for a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. Before that, I graduated from the University of Birmingham with First Honor Degree. 

I used to work in [Covid Corpus](https://www.covidcorpus.org/Home) PhD group led by Dr Mohammed Bahja at the University of Birmingham. My responsibility is to design and implement Natural Language Processing modules, including Topic Modeling, Text Summarization and Article Recommendation.

After that, I mainly focus on Natural Language Generation tasks. During my master's degree, I was working on Few-Shot Learning for Table-to-Text Generation. The model makes state-of-the-art results using improvement techniques such as memory storage and prototype instance selection.

Here is my [CV](https://miraclove.com/cv/).
